BinStorm is a React Native styling utility for rapidly building custom user interfaces

It is different from frameworks like Shoutem, Native Base, or UI Kitten in that it's not a UI kit.

It doesn't have a default theme, and there are no built-in UI components.

But importantly, it contains all the helpers that will help you to build your application design. Rather than pre-defined components & theme which controls how your app should look.

If you're looking for a framework that comes with prebuilt widgets/components to build your app with, BinStorm might not be the right framework for you. 

## Example
See the [official examples](https://github.com/binbytes/binstorm-example) for usage reference with the latest version of BinStorm.
